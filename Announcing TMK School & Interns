You can have a Ph.D. degree and still be a fool.
at the same time, a beggar can have more intelligence than you

So the right thing for you to do at this time is not how to get marks but how to gain a skill
hereby I am announcing TMK Interns

The Motive is to create Free minded souls who can bend an imaginary idea 
into an actual product or a company.

TMK School & Interns
At TMK School we discuss Liberal Arts that include 
1. History
2. Philosophy
3. Mathematics with respect to real world
4. Science with respect to real world
5. Communication Skills
6. Software with TMK Projects

TMK Interns: 
I started doing projects very early on in my life which is 17 
and it took almost 6 years of consecutive failures to reach this place. 
and here are the things that I have learned from people around me.
For any business/Startup to get successful,
we need 6 things
1. Management - Philosophy
2. Accounts - Engineering  + Mathematics
3. Marketing - Showing your project progress with honesty
4. R& D , Product Development - Backwards from Future to present
5. Software - Backbone of any business
6. Feedback - Listening to customers and showing empathy


If you can understand these, you can do anything in your life.

So if you want to learn the above 6 with real projects, join the tmk interns group 
where I post small tasks time to time and whoever has time can join me at TMK Cafe 
and can learn with the projects that I am doing currently.

Perks:
1. Time spent with young minds
2. Networking
3. Food
